### Knowledge base for Robot's interaction with Human, IOT, AI and another Robot included in this resource:

Blockchain is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. Each block typically contains a hash pointer as a link to a previous block, a timestamp and transaction data. It enables digital currency named Ethereum.

Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts on a custom built Blockchain. It provides a cryptocurrency token called "ether" and enables the decentralized web3.

web3 is a platform for decentralized apps (dApps).

Dapps is a Decentralized Applications on web3 which connect Frontend with Smart Contract on Blockchain.

MetaMask is a Dapps browsers as Chrome extension. Allows you to run Ethereum dApps right in your browser without running a full Ethereum node.

DAO : Decentralized Autonomous Organization,

### Developers

web3.js is the Ethereum compatible JavaScript API which implements the Generic JSON RPC spec. It's available on npm as a node module.

Truffle is a NodeJS Framework for Ethereum, use for compile, deploy smart contract.

Solidity is a contract-oriented, high-level language whose syntax is similar to that of JavaScript and it is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

ABI : Application Binary Interface, is basically how you call functions in a contract and get data back.

IPC : Inter-process Communications, the mechanisms an operating system provides to allow the processes to manage shared data.

RPC : Remote Procedure Calls, a kind of requestâ€“response protocol
