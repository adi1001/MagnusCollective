# MagnusCollective
A cognitive and collaborative collective between
Artificial Intelligence, Robots, Humans, Sensor
Networks and distributed hardware built on
the Ethereum smart contracts. Magnus starts a
new era of business, technology, and, thinking.
The Magnus Era brings with it a fundamental
change in how intelligent systems are built and
interact with each other. Magnus’s end goal is to
make people smarter, machines better, Robots
cheaper and faster, and, AI better by ensuring a
collaboration with other agents in the Magnus
Collective network.
In addition Magnus will have its own independent
agent bots called “Sentry Bots” which will ensure
that rogue agents are out of the Magnus network.
Sentry Bots will use a whitelist and blacklist to
maintain reputation and efficiency in the Magnus
network.
Magnus will be able to negotiate and transact
with other block chain or non-block chain
based network that will come in the future using
gateways called Portals. Portals will ensure that
even if Magnus does not obtain leadership in
terms of the network - Magnus will never become
obsolete or outdated . Portals will translate the
negotiation and requests between different
networks and open up Magnus to all the external
networks that are being created.
