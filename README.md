### Knowledge base for Robot's interaction with Human, IOT, AI and another Robot included in this resource:

[Blockchain](https://www.blockchain.com/) is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. Each block typically contains a hash pointer as a link to a previous block, a timestamp and transaction data. It enables digital currency named Ethereum.

[Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts on a custom built Blockchain. It provides a cryptocurrency token called "ether" and enables the decentralized web3.

[IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) InterPlanetary File System is a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol designed to create a permanent and decentralized method of storing and sharing files. 

[web3](http://ethdocs.org/en/latest/introduction/web3.html) is a platform for decentralized apps (dApps).

[Dapps](http://www.ethereumwiki.com/ethereum-wiki/dapps/) is a Decentralized Applications on web3 which connect Frontend with Smart Contract on Blockchain.

[MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) is a Dapps browsers as Chrome extension. Allows you to run Ethereum dApps right in your browser without running a full Ethereum node.

[DAO](https://ethereum.org/dao) : Decentralized Autonomous Organization,

### Developers

[web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/) is the Ethereum compatible JavaScript API which implements the Generic JSON RPC spec. It's available on npm as a node module.

[Truffle](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle) is a NodeJS Framework for Ethereum, use for compile, deploy smart contract.

[Solidity](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#solidity) is a contract-oriented, high-level language whose syntax is similar to that of JavaScript and it is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

[ABI](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Contract-ABI) : Application Binary Interface, is basically how you call functions in a contract and get data back.

IPC : Inter-process Communications, the mechanisms an operating system provides to allow the processes to manage shared data.

RPC : Remote Procedure Calls, a kind of requestâ€“response protocol
