# MagnusCollective
A cognitive and collaborative collective between
Artificial Intelligence, Robots, Humans, Sensor
Networks and distributed hardware built on
the Ethereum smart contracts. Magnus starts a
new era of business, technology, and, thinking.
The Magnus Era brings with it a fundamental
change in how intelligent systems are built and
interact with each other. Magnus’s end goal is to
make people smarter, machines better, Robots
cheaper and faster, and, AI better by ensuring a
collaboration with other agents in the Magnus
Collective network.
In addition Magnus will have its own independent
agent bots called “Sentry Bots” which will ensure
that rogue agents are out of the Magnus network.
Sentry Bots will use a whitelist and blacklist to
maintain reputation and efficiency in the Magnus
network.
Magnus will be able to negotiate and transact
with other block chain or non-block chain
based network that will come in the future using
gateways called Portals. Portals will ensure that
even if Magnus does not obtain leadership in
terms of the network - Magnus will never become
obsolete or outdated . Portals will translate the
negotiation and requests between different
networks and open up Magnus to all the external
networks that are being created.

### Knowledge base for Robot's interaction with Human, IOT, AI and another Robot included in this resource:

[Blockchain](https://www.blockchain.com/) is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. Each block typically contains a hash pointer as a link to a previous block, a timestamp and transaction data. It enables digital currency named Ethereum.

[Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts on a custom built Blockchain. It provides a cryptocurrency token called "ether" and enables the decentralized web3.

[IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) InterPlanetary File System is a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol designed to create a permanent and decentralized method of storing and sharing files. 

[web3](http://ethdocs.org/en/latest/introduction/web3.html) is a platform for decentralized apps (dApps).

[Dapps](http://www.ethereumwiki.com/ethereum-wiki/dapps/) is a Decentralized Applications on web3 which connect Frontend with Smart Contract on Blockchain.

[MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) is a Dapps browsers as Chrome extension. Allows you to run Ethereum dApps right in your browser without running a full Ethereum node.

[DAO](https://ethereum.org/dao) : Decentralized Autonomous Organization,

### Developers

[web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/) is the Ethereum compatible JavaScript API which implements the Generic JSON RPC spec. It's available on npm as a node module.

[Truffle](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle) is a NodeJS Framework for Ethereum, use for compile, deploy smart contract.

[Solidity](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#solidity) is a contract-oriented, high-level language whose syntax is similar to that of JavaScript and it is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

[ABI](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Contract-ABI) : Application Binary Interface, is basically how you call functions in a contract and get data back.

IPC : Inter-process Communications, the mechanisms an operating system provides to allow the processes to manage shared data.

RPC : Remote Procedure Calls, a kind of request–response protocol
