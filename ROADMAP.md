ROADMAP TO A FULLY
AUTONOMOUS SYNTAGMA

In the early phases of network development, the
Collective key management will make some of the
governance decisions, which then will be migrated
over to a purely democratic governance as the
collective evolves.

Changes to the Syntagma are called Amendments.
Major changes are called primary amendments
and minor changes are called secondary
amendments.

The following is the timeline for the Syntagma evolution
### Years 2017-2019 :
### Magnus Vulcan, Romulus , Klingon and Talaxian

a. The first two years preceding the token sale,
primary and secondary amendments are to be
determined by Magnus Collective Leadership, in
accordance with the by-laws of the Collective
installed at time of network inception.

### Years 2020-2021 :
### Magnus Kazon and Ocampa

a. For primary amendments in the operation of
Magnus Collective : Agreement of the Magnus
