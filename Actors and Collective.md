### ACTORS AND THE COLLECTIVE

The collective operates in a manner that the
different actors can interact with each other in
a frictionless manner. Each actor has a Verifier
Ranking, Buyer Ranking and a Seller Ranking
which is assigned according to their past activities
in the collective.
All the actors are assigned a base ranking of 4
when entering the collective for each Verifier,
Buyer and Seller attributes

### THE DYNAMICS OF PROVIDING SERVICES IN ROBOTICS AND AI

Many Magnus Collective Actors will live on the
cloud, houses or even as minute representation
in the form of different IOT devices. Embedded
devices that join the collective will be able
to exchange data and AI services with other
embedded devices containing Magnus Collective
actors, as well as with Magnus Collective actors in
the cloud and elsewhere; and they will be able to
carry out financial exchanges associated with these
data and AI exchanges using tokens.
The home robots created by Ingen (a co-founding
organization of Magnus Collective) will be a
proving ground for some of the first embedded
Robotic Collectives. Robotics and AI collectives
can also barter transactions with each - exchanging
skills.

### ROBOTICS IN THE COLLECTIVE

a. Security in Robot Collectives and Cloud
Robotics

In commercial applications security is of
paramount importance - and this has in ways been
hindering a large scale deployment of a swarm or
cloud of Robotics. Mechanisms through which
members of the group of Robots can trust each
other is the central point here. This also helps
screen out members of the collective that has
malicious intent.

There are four key elements here are

• Data confidentiality

• Data integrity

• Entity authentication

• Data origin authentication

Magnus Collective by the features of the block
chain built underneath it can address all these key
elements in a comprehensive manner. Magnus
Collective can provide not only a reliable peer-topeer
communication channel to swarm’s agents,
but are also a way to overcome potential threats ,
vulnerabilities , hack attacks and phishing attacks.
